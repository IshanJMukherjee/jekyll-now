Per advice [here](https://www.perell.com/blog/why-you-should-write) and [here](https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/), I have decided to start a blog to better understand the complex argumentation I come across in my daily reading. Specifically, I wish to write posts on the topics mentioned below. This blog post will probably be regularly updating, or I will delete it when all the topics have been covered (or deemed not interesting enough to write about) and create a new post.

1. Either a "debater's guide to the conflicts in the Middle East" series of posts or an interesting and not-so-talked about facet of each conflict. The latter is more likely (I certainly can't write better than the authors of [BBC guides](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-13855203) or [CFR Backgrounders](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounders) to offer the former) but also more time-taking. 
2. What is the future of healthcare coverage in the US? I want to examine the Affordable Care Act, the Medicare for All proposal, and Republican alternatives. 
3. 
4. A look at the four years of the Trump presidency - a term report of sorts. May contain thoughts about what should be the priorities of the Democratic administration.
5. A review of the criticisms in Bryan Caplan's *The Case Against Education* and how (if) they apply to Indian high school.

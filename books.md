Here, I document the books that I am currently reading, have read, or plan to read soon. In the "have read" category, I include only those books which I read after the start of 2020, finished at least half of, and found especially interesting. Arranged in no particular order.

## Currently reading:

- *The Case Against Education* by Bryan Caplan
- *Principles of Comparative Politics* by William R. Clark, Sona N. Golder and Matt Golder
- *Macroeconomics* by Gregory N. Mankiw
- *Intermediate Microeconomics: A Modern Approach* by Hal Varian
- *Black Swan* by Nicholas Nassim Taleb

## Plan to read soon:

Books that I am especially excited appear in __bold__. However, at the cost of repeating myself, the books in this list are arranged in no particular order. (Note: There are several reasons I could be excited to read a certian book, not the least of which is that I could have already part of it or the book is on the recommended reading list of a college that I'm gunning for.)
